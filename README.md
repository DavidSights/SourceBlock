# SourceBlock

SourceBlock is an open source [Minecraft PE](https://minecraft.net/) server, written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), built on top of [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/).

Currently in early development, SourceBlock's aim is to become a highly performant Minecraft PE server, with all the expected features of current Minecraft PE versions, including support for redstone, mobs, animals, and many others currently not found in other Minecraft PE versions. There are a lot of features that still need to be implemented, so the more help, the better. **All developers are welcome!**

SouceBlock is built with Swift to encourage a low barrier of entry to new programmers, and to take advantage of the constant language and framework improvements made by the Swift community, revolving around flexibility and performance.

## Goals

### Current

- [ ] Make responsive to Minecraft PE with basic or no features

### Long term

- [ ] Plugin support
- [ ] Redstone
- [ ] Entity AI
- [ ] High quality terrain generation (including underwater)
- [ ] The Nether
- [ ] The End

### Nice to have
